\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b\f0\fs22\lang9 About the framework:\par
\b0 The framework is implemented using Cucumber, PageObject, Maven, TestNG, Listeners, Screenshots, ExtentReporting, PropertiesData Input, baseclass, FirefoxAndChromeExecution (In order to run in Firefox or Chrome, go to "src/main/java/resources/data.properties" and change the value to "firefox" or "chrome")\par
File Name: TestScenario.Feature uses Gherkin so that the test case is easily understandable by all.\par
\b Reports:\par
\b0 FolderName: \par
1) reports/index.html\par
or\par
2) test-output/index.html\par
or\par
3) target/cucumber/index.html\par
\b How To Run The TestCases:\par
\b0 Import the project in Eclipse(or others), go to "pom.xml" and run as "Maven Test"\par
\par
\b Things that can be improved:\par
\b0 1) Reporting by implementing Extent reports in detailed way\par
2) Methods can be more generalized\par
3) Test cases can be more organised\par
4) Test Cases and TestSuite can be created and can be ran using Jenkins\b\par

\b About the TestCases Flow:\par
\b0 Test Case One: @BBCHomePage\par
We are visiting the BBC home page and verifying the top navigation links using the method AssertIfPresentOnPageByLinksUsingLinkText, which captures the href attribute of the link and asserts it with the link provided as a parameter. If the links captured are similar to link provided the Test case passes.\par
\par
Test Case Two: @DateAndDay\par
We are verifying the day and date on the page by using method AssertTwoTestComparison, this takes two String inputs and asserts them if both are same. The first input given is the date captured from the system with format EEEE, dd MMMM and second input given is Date capture from the BBC Home page with the same format EEEE, dd MMMM. If both the dates are same the Test case passes\par
\par
Test Case Three: @NewsSection\par
In this test case we visit the news page and verify the URL of the news page by using method Assert Current URL, this method captures the current url in the browser and asserts it with the url provided as a parameter. If both url matches the testcase passes\par
\par
Test Case Four: @SearchResults\par
In this test we search a string in search bar and assert the url with searchtems by using method Assert current URL and then check if the search results are displayed correct or not by using method AssertIfTextPresentOnPage, it verifies if text is present on the page or no by using assert.\par
